<p class="fp">Hi [First Name],</p>
<p>Programming is one of the most powerful skills to gain right now. Why? Because<br>
  it offers unparalleled flexibility. You can work remotely, freelance, or even start<br>
  your own business. Along the way, you'll master creative problem-solving,
  logical thinking, and efficiency.</p>
  <p class="fp">Here's how to get started:</p>
  <div class="fp1">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Get Your Necessities:</b> Start with a computer or laptop. It doesn’t need to<br>
  be top-of-the-line—just something reliable with the right specs. You'll also<br>
  need internet access and some essential software (Visual Studio, Xcode,<br>
  Python, or C++).
      </li>
      <li>
       <b>Set Goals and Work Towards Them:</b> Think about what you want to<br>
achieve and set a clear path. Include timeframes, objectives, and specific<br>
tasks to stay focused and prevent frustration along the way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Follow a Tailored Learning Experience:</b> Your strengths are unique, so<br>
finding a learning approach that works best for you is key. Try YouTube<br>
videos, self-learning platforms, or—if you want fast-tracked<br>
progress—consider getting personalized guidance
      </li>
      <li><b>Focus on Real-World Projects:</b> Hands-on projects are your ticket to<br>
        building an impressive portfolio and gaining industry-relevant skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stay Updated:</b> The tech field evolves quickly. Keep up with new methods<br>
and trends to stay competitive; watch recent videos or follow blogs that
discuss industry changes.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
